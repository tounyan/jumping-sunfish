This is my first introductory project at Deakin University to C# (and Object-Oriented Programming in general). Jumping Sunfish is a FlappyBird copycat game utilising the SplashKit library. Player uses the space bar to move a sunfish vertically, getting point by navigating seaweeds and poison, finding pearl and eating shrimp. The game comes with 3 levels: Easy - Medium - Hard.

## Getting started

To run this game, you will need to install [*SplashKit SDK*](https://www.splashkit.io/articles/installation/)

Next, navigate to the local folder where you cloned the repository, and run:
```
$ skm dotnet run
```
Give it a few seconds to compile, then enjoy.

This is utterly a very rudimentary project code-wise. Maybe one day I will come back and fix it up.
